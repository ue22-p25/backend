And from time to time 🥳 it must process a request!

````

````{div}
:class: center
It's the **physical or virtual** machine connected to the network that will receive data packets but will in no case take care of processing this data
````

### Le serveur hardware : différents types

````{div}
:class: center
Physical server vs virtual server (VPS)
````

`````{div}

````

````{div}

```{image} media/vps.excalidraw.svg
```
````

Different solutions: On Premise vs Cloud (OVH, Azure, GCP, AWS, ... )

## Serveur et serveur deux choses différentes

### The "software" server

````{div}
:class: center
```{image} media/server-app.excalidraw.svg
:width: 65%
```
````

It's the application (in the software sense) that will take care of

````{div}
:class: center
**Receive**, **Process** and **Respond** to HTTP requests (or others for that matter)
````

Different solutions: Nginx (33%), Apache (27%), LiteSpeed (15%), Node.js(4%), IIS (4%), ...

## Host multiple HTTP(S) servers on the same physical server?

````{div}
:class: center
YES 🎯 just share port 80 🤝
````

````{div}
:class: center
```{image} media/virtual-host.excalidraw.svg
:width: 80%
```
````

````{div}
:class: center
Just configure **Virtual Hosts** at the HTTP server level
````

### virtual hosts

Example of nginx config with two different sites on the same physical server


`````{div}

```
````

````{div}
:class: fifty center
```{image} media/servername-cpp.png
:width: 70%
```
````
`````

````{div}
:class: center
the "routing" between the two sites is done based on the `Host:` Header of the HTTP request
````

## A word about serverless

````{div}
:class: center
A traditional server spends its time waiting ... 🥱
````

````{div}
:class: center
**_A serverless is a server that does not wait_**
````

The principle is to break down processing into small **independent tasks** (functions) that will be executed **on demand**

`````{div}
:class: columns

````{div}
:class: fifty center

### Advantages

- No server management
- No fixed cost
- Scalable
````

````{div}
:class: fifty center

### Disadvantages/Difficulties

- Startup time
- Usage cost
- Debugging difficulty
- Stateless
````

`````

Lower cost for providers because they can optimize resource usage

## Do all servers do the same thing?

**Two applications**

````{div}
:class: center
Static vs dynamic sites
````

`````{div}
:class: columns

````{div}
:class: fifty center
<iframe src="https://cpp.bmarchand.fr/controlSection.html" width="100%" height="400px" frameBorder="0"></iframe>
````
````{div}
:class: fifty center
<iframe width="100%" height="400px" src="https://xkcd.com"></iframe>
````
`````

---

### Static site

````{div}
:class: center
The HTTP server only does one thing
<br>
**_read files_** html, png, jpg, pdf, .... and **_send the content to the client**

<br>

```{image} media/site-static.excalidraw.svg
:width: 90%
```

<br>see for example [the C++ course site](https://cpp.bmarchand.fr)

````

---

### Dynamic site (basic)

````{div}
:class: center
The HTTP server will have to work **with other services** <br>in order to produce the final result that can be sent to the client

```{image} media/site-dynamic.excalidraw.svg
:width: 90%
```

<br>For example: [a medium e-commerce site](https://vraimentbeau.com)
````

---

### Dynamic site (advanced)

````{div}
:class: center

On the other hand, the architecture behind a dynamic site can also be very very complex

```{image} media/cerebro.png

```


<br>For example: [a development platform](https://rep.minesparis.psl.eu)
