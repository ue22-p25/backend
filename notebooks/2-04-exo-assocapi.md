# exo: assocapi with FastAPI

(label-exo-assocapi)=
## Small practical break

**Objective**: Set up an API allowing access to CSV file content

You have <https://github.com/ue22-p25/backend-assocapi-frontend> a ready-made frontend!  
And you have <https://github.com/ue22-p25/backend-assocapi-skeleton> a backend to complete

The backend API must **imperatively** respect the routes documented in the README.

```{admonition} automatic doc with FastAPI !
:class: smaller
Once your code works, go visit the `/docs/` route to see the interactive doc of your API.
```

````{admonition} tip for copying repositories
:class: smaller tip dropdown

 to copy the content of these repositories on your machine, rather than using `git clone`, you can use this
```bash
# if necessary (npx command not found)
# conda install conda-forge::nodejs

# download the repo in the 'frontend' folder
npx degit ue22-p25/backend-assocapi-frontend frontend
# same for the backend
npx degit ue22-p25/backend-assocapi-skeleton backend
```

which has the advantage of not recreating a git repository in the created folder; especially if you place yourself in an already existing repository like `backend-homework`  
(but doesn't prevent you from `git add` the result immediately)

## Tip #1: *auto-reload*

- you notice that FastAPI applications do not contain code to execute directly  
  (just route definitions)
- so if you launch the python file with `python my_file.py`, it does nothing!
- that's why it's **essential** to launch the app with `fastapi dev assocapi.py`
- also and especially, the server **restarts by itself** at each code modification  

````{div}
:class: smaller
and same for the frontend by the way; if you intend to touch it, it's better to launch it with `vite`, so it restarts by itself at each modification
````

## Tip #2: typed parameters

- a route can take a parameter, possibly typed

`````{div}
:class: columns
````{div}
:class: fifty
```python
# untyped parameter

@app.route('/hello/{name}')
  def hello(name):
    # here name is a simple str
    # it's up to you
    # to check its content
    return f'Hello, {name}!'
```
````

````{div}
:class: fifty
```python
# here with a path parameter
# note how it is typed

@app.route('/hello/{id}')
  def hello(id: int):
    """
    fastapi does the control and conversion of 'id'
    automatically for you, so you can be sure that 'id' is an int in the function body

    also this docstring ends up in the automatic documentation
    """
    return f'Hello, {id**2}!'
```
````
`````

## Tip #3: return types

to shorten the code, the return type of a route implies automatic processing  
we hardly need to convert objects to dict/json  
especially if we use Pydantic models (we'll talk about it again...)

| Route return                   | HTTP response                                                                      |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `dict` or `list` or `int` or `float` | Automatically encoded in JSON.                                                   |
| `str`                                | Sent as raw text (`text/plain`)                                            |
| Pydantic `BaseModel`                 | JSON automatically.                                                             |
|                                      | Example: `return Item(name="Apple", price=1.5)` <br> → `{"name":"Apple","price":1.5}` |

## Tip #4: `httpie`

- it's practical to have a real frontend in HTML/CSS/JS
- BUT for development it's useful to test ***also*** the routes in command line in the terminal
- for this **we can use `httpie`** (or `curl` but it's less readable)
- which installs with

  ```bash
  pip install httpie
  ```

- and which is used like this

  ```bash
  # a GET
  http GET http://localhost:8000/hello
  # or abbreviated
  http :8000/hello

  # a POST
  http POST http://localhost:8000/hello var=value
  # by the way with an assignment of this type the POST is automatic
  # which makes the following command equivalent
  http :8000/hello var=value
  ```

- and as always, do `http --help` or see the doc for more details...
